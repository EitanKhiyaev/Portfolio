  paragraphOne: 'As a current CSCI student at John Jay, I joined the TTP Residency to gain hands-on experience as a developer and increase my knowledge in web development. I wanted to specialize in web development since I was in high school because I loved the concept of being able to mix my two passions of coding and design. As my career as a developer expands, so does my knowledge. In the TTP residency  Iâ€™ve worked with many tools such as Javascript, HTML, CSS, Django,  React.js , Node.js , Github and Slack.',
  paragraphTwo: 'Each of these different tools that I learned helped me with many aspects such  as working in a team, collaboration, communication, working faster and more efficiently with tools, and adapting. I had the opportunity to work in groups of 5 to build websites using Git and GitHub for version control. We also used discord for project management and slack for communicating. ',
  paragraphThree: 'I personally believe that web development is the future. New websites are built every day and the numbers will only grow. This is why I want to be a part of this team and implement features, make them more friendly. And make the websites more appealing.',
